# KNN and Decision Tree applied to the Iris classification problem

This repository is dedicated to the implementation and analysis of two machine learning techniques: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These classic algorithms are applied to the well-known [Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). The Iris dataset was introduced by the renowned statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 and further enriched by Edgar Anderson to quantify morphological variation of Iris flower species. It contains 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor) with four features measured: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals in centimeters.

## Objectives

The aim of this project is to utilize Decision Trees and KNN in classifying the different species of the Iris flowers based on their morphological features. This task involves comparing the performance of both algorithms and understanding their strengths and weaknesses in the context of the Iris dataset.
